// In order to create this file:
//      Make sure the Pitch Perfect yellow folder is selected, then Command+N to create new file
//      Choose Cocoa Touch Class, and make it a subclass of UIViewController
// Then go to storyboard and make sure this class is selected in the desired ViewController's attributes


// For the UI, we will have a vertical StackView as our base, and have horizontal StackViews inside (each with Buttons)
